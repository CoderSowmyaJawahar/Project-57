        <p>Coding is one of the things I love to do most. Coding is realy fun when I try to do it. and I can do coding easily if I pay attention to my teacher's words.this is the story how learnt coding:
            I was like 8 years when my mother decided for me to learn coding. And I didn't know anything about it. My mother told me that she has booked a trial class when it was the day before the trial class.The very next day I was asking my parents "what is coding" but they didn't know how to answer. So when it was time for me to attend the trial class I didn't even know how to open a new tab!! then my teacher started. I was very ,like, how will I speak to my teacher? but then I understood that Coding wasn't hard at all. Then slowly I stared to learn more about computers and coding too.</p>
